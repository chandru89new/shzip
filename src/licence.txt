Archetype Foundry fonts comes with two types of licenses—
• Desktop, for installation on computers and to be consumed by desktop design apps such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Indesign or IDEs such as Visual Studio Code, Atom, Webstorm and so on.
• Web, for use in websites, web apps, landing pages, web ads, emailers, newsletters, server-side interfaces and so on.

Desktop license — OTF file format

What you can do—
• Install it on upto 3(three) workstation or computer per purchase.
• You may do any kind of graphic design, including logo design.
• The font may be used in non-editable PDF embedding and other similar documents.

What you cannot do—
• You may not sell, redistribute, adapt, modify, disassemble, reverse engineer the font without permission.
• You may not convert to webfont formats.


Web license — WOFF/WOFF2 file format
------------------------------------

• Install the font on 1(one) domain per purchase. Multiple sub-domains are fine.
• Use the font in any kind of online web environment.

What you cannot do—
• Install it on multiple domains or deployments. For example, you cannot use it in two different websites, even though they are hosted on the same server.
• You may not convert to desktop formats.


For other licenses such as Android/iOS app, mobile/PC/web game, large enterprise multi-platform, educational, etc, please write to hello@archetype-foundry.com.

Both these licenses can be used for both personal and commercial purposes, and they are perpetual. Once purchased, you may be eligible for updates and upgrades of the font at no cost, at the discretion of the foundry. Once purchased, there will be no refund possible, as we cannot determine if the font has been wiped from your systems. However, under special circumstances, should the font not install or perform as intended, and this is due to some technical discrepancy in the downloaded font file, there remains a possibility of refund— again, at the discretion of the foundry.
